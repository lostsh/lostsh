### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my chair, okay it sucks, I work on various projects, in particular the Self-e project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning also lots of things ! stuff like some programming languages, or computer paradigms, practices or whatever
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want !

## About me
I am in the second year of a DUT in computer science.
I have been passionate about computers for a long time, before knowing how to program I learned to repair, assemble and install computers, then came the code, and I really love it all.

I like computer projects, I am a big fan of **Raspberry pi** since the release of the 1B + model moreover I also particularly like **Aduino**
